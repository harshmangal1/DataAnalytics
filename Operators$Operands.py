# Operators and Operands:
"""
Operators indicates what operation is to be performed while
operands indicates on what the action or the operation shuld
be performed.
x + y = 0
In the given expression, x,y, and 0 are Operands and + are operator

Types of operators:
Operators can be further divided into 6 categories:
1. Arithmetic operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Identity Operators
6. Membership Operators
7. Bitwise Operators

# Arithmetic Operators=> Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*)
                        Division(/), Modulus(%), Exponentiation(**), Floor division(//)
1 + 2 = 3
2 - 1 = 1
2 * 1 = 2
4 / 2 = 2
expo 2 ** 10 = 2th power 10
modulus 8 % 3 = 2(remainder)
floor division 8 // 2 = 2(Quotient)

# Comparion operators=> Less than(<), Greater than(>), Equal to(==),
                       Less than equal to (<=), Greater than equal to (>=)
                       Not equal to (!=)
# Logical Operators=> * and:
                        true if both the operands are true
                        ex- x and y
                      * or:
                        True if either of the operands is true
                        ex- x or y
                      * not:
                        True if operand is false (complements the operand)
                        ex- not x
# Assignment Operator=> it used in python to assign values to variables.
                        a = 6 is a simple assignment operator that assign the
                        value 6 on the right to the variable a on the left.

                        operator        Example          Equivalent to
                        =               x = 6            x = 6
                        +=              x += 6           x = x + 6
                        -=              x -= 6           x = x - 6
                        *=              x *= 6           x = x * 6

# Identity Operators=> identity operators are used to compare items to see if they
                       are the same object with the same memory address.
                       Types: 1. Is
                              2. Is not
                       a = 1234
                       b = "1234"
                       print(a is b)
                       OUTPUT- false

# Bitwise Operators=> These operators are used to compare the Binary numbers
                    Types: 1. AND (&) Operator
                           2. OR (|) Operator
                           3. XOR (^) Operator
                           4. << zero fill left shift
                           5. << zero fill right shift
# Membership Operators=> Membership operators are used to check the presence of a
                         Sequence in an object.
                         Types : 1. In
                                 2. not in
                         Example :
                         a = "hello"
                         print ("p" in a)

                         OUTPUT :
                         false
